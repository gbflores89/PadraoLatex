  abstract = {A dynamic mathematical model of reactive distillation in case of kinetically
	controlled chemical reaction is formulated using four basic assumptions:
	negligible vapour holdup compared to the molar liquid holdup, perfect
	mixing of phases, corrections of equilibrium values by plate efficiency,
	corrections of conversion for mixing effects by "conversion efficiency".
	The accuracy of the dynamic simulation results of reactive distillation
	obtained under different assumptions is verified by comparing with
	results of actual experiments on a pilot-scale distillation column.
	Both the unsteady-state period during start-up and the disturbances
	of continuous operation are considered. Esterification of ethanol
	with acetic acid with sulphuric acid as homogeneous catalyst is chosen
	for experiments. Accuracy of simulation is very good in case of model
	containing hydraulic description of plates with regard to temperatures
	inside column and in the reboiler. Responses of component concentrations
	are less accurate, but imposed disturbances were very large. Observed
	differences result from simplifications of mathematical model, inaccuracy
	of the kinetic and vapour-liquid equilibrium description for highly
	nonideal, multicomponent system and from precision of experimental
	measurements in case of transient state. Differences between experimental
	and simulation results in case of different models are the most significant
	for large holdup on plates in comparison with reboiler. As a general
	rule, in case of reactive distillation simulation for dynamics, description
	models taking into consideration plate hydraulics should be used.},

  journal = {Chemical Engineering and Processing},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {43},
  pages = {435--445},
  abstract = {The hardware design of reactive distillation (RD) columns pose severe
	challenges with respect to the choice and design of the hardware;
	the requirements of reaction (i.e. high liquid or catalyst holdup)
	is not in consonance with the requirement of separation (high interfacial
	area). In this paper, we examine an alternative to the RD concept,
	namely a distillation column networked with a number of side (external)
	reactors. If each distillation stage is linked to a side reactor,
	the performance of the RD column is matched exactly. From a practical
	point of view, it is desirable to reduce the number of side reactors
	to below, say, six. The precise location of the chosen number of
	side reactors
	
	and the manner in which the liquid draw-offs and reactor effluent
	re-entry to the distillation column needs to be chosen carefully.
	We have developed an algorithm to determine an optimum configuration
	of the side-reactor concept in order to maximise conversion. For
	the case study of methyl acetate production, we see that it is possible
	to match the conversion level of an RD column by appropriate choice
	of the number of side reactors and the pump around ratio. The higher
	the conversion target the larger the number of side reactors and
	pump around ratios. For modest conversion levels, say <90%, even
	a 3-side-reactor configuration will be able to match the performance
	of the RD column. The study presented here reveals the potential,
	and limitations, of the side-reactor concept for use as an alternative
	to RD technology.},

  pages = {2085--2102},
  abstract = {In this paper we develop a generic, dynamic, nonequilibrium (NEQ)
	stage model for reactive distillation (RD) columns. The main features
	of our model are: (1) use of the Maxwell-Stefan equations for describing
	mass transfer between fluid phases, (2) solid catalysed reactions
	are treated using a pseudo-homogeneous liquid phase model with the
	appropriate pseudo-homogeneous kinetic expressions and (3) a comprehensive
	set of design correlations, for both trays (sieve, bubble caps) and
	packings (random dumped, structured), for hold-up and mass transfer
	have been incorporated into the software package following earlier
	work (Taylor et al., Comput. Chem. Eng. 18 (1994) 205). We report
	some interesting dynamic features of RD columns by examining the
	response of a column for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) synthesis
	to perturbations in the feed of methanol, iso-butene or n-butene.
	When operating at a highconversion branch of the bifurcation diagram,
	small perturbations are shown to lead to a transition to a low-conversion
	branch. The NEQ model is shown to be more susceptible to feed perturbations
	than a conventional equilibrium (EQ) model with constant component
	eficiencies. The di!erences between the dynamic behaviour of trayed
	and random-packed columns are also emphasised in this work. The dynamic
	behaviour of the column has been interpreted on the basis of the
	iso-butene recycle flow in the column. It has been shown that the
	size, type and duration of a feed perturbation causing a transition
	from one to another steady state depends on the model description,
	on the column configuration and on the residence time distribution
	along the column height. Experimental
	
	verification of the developed dynamic model is obtained by comparison
	with the experimental results of Mohl et al. (Chem. Eng. Sci. 54
	(1999) 1029) for synthesis of tertiary amyl ether (TAME).},

	cell model by means of three case studies: (1) metathesis of 2-propene
	in an RD column, (2) distillation of methanol-iso-propanol-water,
	and (3) synthesis of methyl tert-butylether (MTBE) in an RD column.
	For comparison purposes we have also carried out dynamic simulations

	to draw the following conclusions. The introduction of staging in
	the liquid and vapour phases not only influences the steady-state
	performance, by increasing reaction conversion and separation capability,
	but also has a significant influence on column dynamics. With multiple
	cells per stage the column dynamics becomes much more sensitive to
	perturbations. Furthermore, we show that even when the NEQ cell model
	and EQ stage model exhibit almost identical steady-state characteristics,
	the dynamic responses of an RD column could even be qualitatively
	diferent. When operating close to the distillation boundary for nonreactive,
	conventional, distillation, small disturbances in feed compositions
	can lead to completely di!erent product compositions.},

	Two tray load regimes are distinguished: an aeration regime and an

	Um "dilema" apresentado é a complexidade de sistema matemático gerado

	São listados os motivos pelo qual a modelagem de pratos reais (com

	1) o sistema de equações gerado se torna um problema numérico muito
	pesado e delicado de ser resolvido 2) ainda não há um conhecimento
	consolidado a cerca de simplificações possíveis nesse tipo de modelagem
	de acordo com cada caso a ser modelado. 
	
	
	Foram implementados dois modelo rigorosos para simular colunas de

	de complexidade de detalhamento. O modelo A apresenta uma forma mais
	simples (menos rigorosa) com coeficientes de transferência de massa

	para ambas as fases através da matriz de coeficientes.
	
	Estes dois modelos coincidem quando não há diferença entre os vários

	- Modelo com pratos de equilíbrio ideais

	(EFV) temperatures at six different locations of the column which
	are correlated with corresponding feed TBP temperatures. The second

	the form of point efficiencies so as to minimize the discrepancy
	between the simulator predicted and measured column parameters which
	arises out of modelling approximations such as assumption of phase
	equilibria at each stage and use of imperfect thermodynamics correlations.
	The simulator results, after tuning, were found to match the plant
	measurements within two percent in all the cases investigated. The
	simulator output was used to predict various product properties using

	Com um modelo simplificado é gerado um parâmetro chamado de razão

	em que o prato já está cheio o suficiente para começar a gerar vapor
	para entrar no prato de cima. Antes deste parâmetro atingir o valor
	especificado, todo o vapor que chega ao prato condensa imediatamente
	contribuindo para o acúmulo de líquido.
	
	No modelo realístico, o vapor que sobre para os pratos condensa na
	parede de prato e cai para o prato abaixo até que o prato encha e
	a parede do prato esquente. Depois disso o vapor sobe mais um prato
	e assim por diante até que todos os pratos encham. O modelo realístico
	necessita de dados sobre o prato para calcular o seu aquecimento.
	
	
	Estes modelos foram validados com dados experimentais retirados de

	specify an efficiency that is the same for all components on all
	stages. However, component efficiencies are not equal in systems
	with more than two components and cannot be correlated, especially
	for nonideal systems. This makes the equilibrium model inappropriate
	for dynamic simulations where these efficiencies are subject to change
	and cannot be specified beforehand. Using constant efficiencies neglects
	the influence of the tray hydrodynamics on the mass transfer and
	the consequences for the column dynamics. Additionally, in certain

	distillation columns is described. The nonequilibrium model incorporates
	the rigorous calculation of the mass and energy transfer rates and
	avoids the use of efficiencies. The influence of mass transfer correlations

  abstract = {The use of tray temperatures to infer compositions is widespread in
	distillation control. A number of criteria have been proposed for
	selecting which trays to hold at constant temperature. The most commonly
	used are (1) choosing a tray where there are large changes in temperature
	from tray to tray ("slope" of the temperature profile), (2) finding
	the tray where there is the largest change in temperature for a change
	in the manipulated variable ("sensitivity"), (3) using singular value
	decomposition (SVD) analysis, (4) selecting the tray where the temperature
	does not change as feed composition changes while producing the desired
	distillate and bottoms purities and (5) choosing the tray that produces
	the smallest changes in product purities when it is held constant
	in the face of feed composition disturbances. 
	
	This paper provides a quantitative comparison of the effectiveness
	of these five alternative criteria. Several systems are considered,
	ranging from ideal binary to azeotropic multi-component. Results
	show that SVD analysis provides a simple and effective method for
	selecting temperature control tray location.},

	can discriminate between relevant and irrelevant process inputs,

	demonstrated by the development of steady-state models for two typical

	A diabatic column is a column with heat exchangers on all trays.
	The method was demonstrated on a distillation column separating propylene
	from propane. The entropy production included contributions from
	the heat transfer in the heat exchangers and the mass and heat transfer
	between liquid and vapor inside the distillation column. It was minimized
	for a number of binary tray distillation columns with fixed heat
	transfer area, number of trays, and feed stream temperature and composition.
	For the first time, the areas of heat exchange were used as variables
	in the optimization. An analytical result is that the entropy production
	due to heat transfer is proportional to the area of each heat exchanger
	in the optimal state. For many distillation columns, this is equivalent
	to a constant driving force for heat transfer. The entropy production
	was reduced with up to 30% in the cases with large heat transfer
	area and many trays. In large process facilities, this reduction
	would ideally lead to 1-2GWh of saved exergy per year. The most important
	variable in obtaining these reductions is the total heat transfer
	area. The investigation was done with a perspective to later include
	the column as a part in an optimization of a larger process. We found
	that the entropy production of the column behaved almost as a quadratic
	function when the composition of the feed stream changed. This means
	that the feed composition is a natural, easy variable for a second
	law optimization when the distillation column is a part of a process.
	The entropy production was insensitive to variations in the feed
	temperature.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new minimum bubble-point distance (MIDI)
	algorithm for assessing the feasibility of a desired distillation
	specification. The algorithm computes the rectifying and stripping
	temperature profiles by temperature collocation on finite elements
	with orthogonal polynomials. We discovered the beneficial use of
	a dimensionless equilibrium tray temperature as an independent variable.
	This novel choice is bounded between 0 and 1, improves the numerical
	quality of the design problem formulation, and is well-behaved even
	in the vicinity of pinch regions. It also employs the fixed points
	of column sections as collocation points. Adaptive-element boundary
	placement at saddle temperatures can effectively overcome problems
	with numerical instability near pinch regions. Extensions of our
	MIDI algorithm to the calculation of the minimum and maximum refluxes
	are also introduced. We show the application of this algorithm in
	the separation of quaternary mixtures and provide an outlook of the
	methodology for optimal column sequencing. Cases studies demonstrate
	the algorithm robustness and reliability.},
